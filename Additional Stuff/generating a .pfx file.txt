To proceed with the code signing process, you need a certificate in pfx format. I would like to share that a PFX file can be created by combining Codesigning(server) certificate, CABundle, and private key.

1. Server Certificate (Codesigning certificate): You will have to copy the content of it in notepad and save it with .crt extension. You can download it from the below path:
On ssl2buy.com, login to your account > My Orders > Open Order# > Click on "Manage SSL" Button > Enter into configuration wizard > Get certificate. From here, the first textbox will have the Server Certificate. Go ahead and copy that into notepad and save it as ServerCertificate.crt.

2. CABundle: You can follow the below steps to create a CABundle. You will get all of the below files from the above path:
a. Intermediate Certificate2
b. Intermediate Certificate1
c. Root Certificate
Now: You need to copy all 3 (root and intermediate)files in one notepad, please make sure to paste these files in the given order Intermediate Certificate2 >> Intermediate Certificate1 >> Root Certificate one below another and save it as CAbundle.crt.

3. Private key: The private key is generated along with the CSR and it should have been saved on your end. You will have to save it with .key Extension (call it PrivateKey.key).

Once you've all 3 files with you, then you can convert the pfx file format from here:
